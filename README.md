## Project Description

A new, unsigned, independent music artist from the United States who has a variety of genres of music released on Spotify desires to know the best response in terms of number of streams. What kind of music in terms of musical characteristics (danceability, acousticness, etc.) should he make next to generate the most streams? 

The artist would like to know what kinds of music in terms of its musical characteristics performs the best in terms of number of streams. They would also like to know what musical characteristics are shared between top charting songs, and also how their own music compares to that of top charting songs in terms of musical characteristics. To that end, there are several research questions we wish to answer through our analysis:

1. What commonalities are shared between top-charting songs in terms of musical characteristics?
Between an individual artist and top-charting artists?
2. Can the musical characteristics of any given top-charting song predict the number of streams it
has?
